# Roadmap

A simple interface for a team's or organization's tasks (e.g. university association). **Demo:** https://ireneu.github.io/roadmap/

### Features

:+1: No web server required. Roadmap can live on the local filesystem or in a shared folder (e.g. DropBox). <br />
:+1: Supports tagging team members in task descriptions. <br />
:-1: Data is stored in js file, no validation. <br />

### Customization


The title, description and team members and tasks for the roadmap are in the `data.js` file.

Updating and adding data should be fairly simple, a text editor that lints javascript may help!
